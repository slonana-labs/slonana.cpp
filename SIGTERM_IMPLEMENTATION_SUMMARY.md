# SIGTERM Resource Exhaustion Prevention - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

The issue was that exit code 143 (SIGTERM) in CI environments could result from **resource exhaustion** causing system-level kills, rather than just timeouts or cancellations. This made it difficult to distinguish between legitimate test failures and infrastructure-related kills.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Resource Monitoring (C++)

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `include/monitoring/resource_monitor.h` - Comprehensive resource monitoring API
- `src/monitoring/resource_monitor.cpp` - Implementation with memory, CPU, disk monitoring
- `src/main.cpp` - Enhanced signal handling and resource integration

**Key Features:**
- Configurable memory headroom checking (default 512MB)
- Real-time resource pressure detection
- Callbacks for resource exhaustion warnings
- Static utility functions for system resource queries
- Thread-safe monitoring with automatic logging

### 2. Enhanced Signal Handling

**Enhanced SIGTERM Detection:**
```cpp
void signal_handler(int signal) {
    if (signal == SIGINT || signal == SIGTERM) {
        std::cout << "\nShutdown signal received (" << signal << ")..." << std::endl;
        
        // Check if this might be resource exhaustion
        if (g_resource_monitor && g_resource_monitor->is_resource_pressure()) {
            std::cout << "‚ö†Ô∏è Resource pressure detected - this may be resource exhaustion SIGTERM" << std::endl;
            g_resource_monitor->log_resource_usage("SIGTERM received under resource pressure");
            g_resource_exhaustion.store(true);
        } else if (signal == SIGTERM) {
            std::cout << "‚ÑπÔ∏è SIGTERM received - checking for resource exhaustion..." << std::endl;
            if (g_resource_monitor) {
                g_resource_monitor->log_resource_usage("SIGTERM received");
            }
        }
        
        g_shutdown_requested.store(true);
    }
}
```

### 3. Python Resource Utilities

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/resource_utils.py` - Python utilities for stress testing integration

**Key Functions (as specified in the issue):**
```python
def ensure_memory_headroom(min_mb: int = 512) -> bool:
    """Utility function to ensure memory headroom (compatible with issue example)."""
    monitor = ResourceMonitor(memory_headroom_mb=min_mb)
    success, message = monitor.ensure_memory_headroom()
    print(message)
    return success
```

**Integration Features:**
- Pre-flight system health checks
- Resource monitoring during stress tests
- Graceful abort when approaching resource limits
- Compatible with existing chaos engineering workflows

### 4. Enhanced Chaos Engineering

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/enhanced_chaos_demo.py` - Demonstration of integrated chaos testing
- `demo_sigterm_prevention.sh` - Complete demo script

**Prevention Strategy:**
1. **Pre-flight checks** - Verify sufficient resources before starting tests
2. **Continuous monitoring** - Track resources during chaos scenarios
3. **Abort conditions** - Stop tests before resource exhaustion
4. **Post-test logging** - Record resource state for analysis

## Test Results

### All Tests Pass ‚úÖ
```
=== Test Summary ===
Tests run: 14
Tests passed: 14
Tests failed: 0
Pass rate: 100%
```

### Comprehensive Testing Coverage
- Basic resource monitoring functionality
- Resource usage formatting and callbacks
- Static utility functions (memory, CPU, disk)
- Integration with main validator process
- Python utilities compatibility
- Chaos engineering integration

## Validation Examples

### Example 1: Normal SIGTERM (No Resource Pressure)
```
Shutdown signal received (15)...
‚ÑπÔ∏è SIGTERM received - checking for resource exhaustion...
SIGTERM received - 01:08:10 | Memory: 1244.8/15995.6MB (7.8%) | CPU: 5.3% | Disk: 25.6/71.6GB available (35.8%)
Exit code: 0 (normal shutdown)
```

### Example 2: Resource Monitoring During Chaos
```
üîç Checking system health before stress testing...
   ‚úÖ Sufficient memory headroom: 14742.9MB available (required: 512MB)
   No resource pressure detected
   
Memory headroom check (512MB required):
‚úÖ Sufficient memory headroom: 14739.4MB available (required: 512MB)
```

### Example 3: Resource Pressure Detection
```
üö® RESOURCE EXHAUSTION WARNING: CRITICAL: Memory usage at 95%
üìä 01:08:37 | Memory: 15200.0/16000.0MB (95.0%) | CPU: 85.0% | Disk: 900.0/1000.0GB available (10.0%)
```

## Impact and Benefits
