Common Metrics Comparison
========================

RPC Response Latency:
  • Agave:           5ms
  • Slonana:         7ms
  • Improvement:     0.71x (lower is better - Agave wins)

Memory Usage:
  • Agave:           1230MB
  • Slonana:         10MB
  • Efficiency:      123.0x (higher means Slonana uses less)

CPU Utilization:
  • Agave:           35.8%
  • Slonana:         4.7%
  • Efficiency:      7.6x (higher means Slonana uses less)

Startup Time:
  • Agave:           2.02s
  • Slonana:         2.02s
  • Improvement:     1.0x (essentially identical)

Summary
=======
⚠️  RPC latency comparison: 0.71x (Agave slightly faster)
✅ Slonana uses 123.0x less memory
✅ Slonana uses 7.6x less CPU
⚠️  Startup time comparison: 1.0x (essentially identical)

Note: Only metrics that both validators can reliably provide are compared.
